# Bluescreen mouse

## What it does
Simply deploys a python payload that first downloads pynput, then it waits for mouse movement. If the mouse moves a blue screen is thrown!

## How to use

This payload is originally made for the OMG Plug, but it is pretty simple to modify to any other duckyscript platform you wish to use.
