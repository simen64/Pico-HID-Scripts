# Bluescreen mouse

## What it does
Simply deploys a powershell payload that waits for mouse movement. If the mouse moves a blue screen is thrown!

## How to use

This payload is originally made for the OMG Plug, but it is pretty simple to modify to any other duckyscript platform you wish to use.

## Credits

The mouse movent function is from I Am Jakoby's powershell for hackers library.
The BSOD function is from peewpw's Invoke-BSOD repo.
