# Payload used to deliver my Discord controlled RAT to a target computer

## Fork

The file you can find here is a fork from my [Simple-Discord-RAT](https://github.com/simen64/Simple-discord-RAT) repo. Only thing i have changed is that instead of the bot token being stored in a .env file it is delivered with the payload.

## Disclaimer!

**DONT** use this on any computer you dont have full authorization to attack!
I am **NOT** responsible for anything harmful done with this paylod.

## What it does

This delivers my discord controlled RAT to a target computer with your own bot token. Read more [here](https://github.com/simen64/Simple-discord-RAT).

## Dependencies

Although the RAT works better on Linux as that was where it was developed this payload only works on windows. This is because Linux is more secure and isnt easy to set processes to run at startup without knowing the sudo password, and other reasons.

- Windows
- Python
- User is admin
